# Speed typing game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

How the app works
First time the app loads, the typing area will be disabled. When player presses the START button, the cursor will focus on typing area immediately then the player can type, and START button is disable. After 10 seconds, typing area will be disabled again, then the number of word will be showed.
